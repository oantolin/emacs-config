* Welcome!

This is my personal Emacs configuration. I tend to prefer learning how
to use built-in packages for any given task. If I get a small itch to
scratch, I'll typically write my own tiny package for it. For itches
too big to handle on my own I do go shopping for external packages.

There is also code I wind up writing with no itch of my own to
scratch: I like reading [[https://reddit.com/r/emacs][r/emacs]] and writing little functions for
people there. The functions I like and think I might use someday
become tiny packages here. Writing small snippets for other people is
probably my favorite way of learning Emacs, because it takes me down
paths I don't think I would explore on my own.

* Some packages I've bundled separately

I intend to publish the most reusable parts of my configuration as
separate packages. So far that is:

- [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][embark]]
- [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][orderless]]
- [[https://github.com/oantolin/icomplete-vertical][icomplete-vertical]]
- [[https://github.com/oantolin/math-delimiters][math-delimiters]]
- [[https://github.com/oantolin/placeholder][placeholder]]
- [[https://github.com/oantolin/epithet][epithet]]
- [[https://github.com/oantolin/completing-history][completing-history]]
- [[https://github.com/oantolin/restricto][restricto]]
- [[https://github.com/oantolin/live-completions][live-completions]]

* Themes

For many years I kept trying Emacs themes and always went back to the
default theme. I don't understand why people don't like the default
theme, to me it is clearly better than almost all others. :)

I finally found themes I like better than the default: Protesilaos
Stavrou's [[https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/modus-themes][modus themes]]!

* What's missing from this repo?

I separated the personal part of my configuration to publish this. The
personal part doesn't cover that much: email addresses and signatures,
org capture templates, org agenda configuration, and the org-publish
configuration for my academic website, basically. In particular most
of my org mode configuration is in this public part.
